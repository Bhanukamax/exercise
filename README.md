Output for all tasks except task 5, will print to console. 

Also as requested for task 5, output for tasks 1 to 4 will also be written into a file called list.txt in the root folder.

## Folder structure
Reusable code is kept in the folder`src/modules`.
Tasks are in the folder `src/tasks`.

## Tasks
I have done all the tasks including the bonus task.

All the task has been written in subfolders under `src/tasks/`, and called in the `src/index.js` file.

If you need to test individual tasks please comment all the tasks, leaving the relevant task uncommented on the `src/index.js` file.

### Task4
Error handling has been turned on for all the tasks by default

Errors can be turned off by passing opening the relevant `get-list.js` file inside each task folder.

### Bonus Tasks

To see the running time for bonus tasks please comment all the other tasks on `src/index.js` and keep only one bonus task uncommented.
